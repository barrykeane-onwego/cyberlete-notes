# Cyberlete Multi-Actor Analysis - Executive Summary
## Key Findings & Immediate Actions

**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Dataset:** 3,991 LinkedIn engagements from 13 gaming ecosystem actors

---

## 🎯 Top 3 Critical Insights

### 1. **Fragmented Attention = No Organic Discovery**
- Only **0.6% overlap** in content sources across 13 actors (9 shared authors out of 1,585)
- Each actor operates in distinct information bubble
- **Implication:** Cyberlete CANNOT rely on viral network effects. Must execute targeted 1:1 outreach.

### 2. **Three Distinct Tribal Clusters Identified**
- **Cluster 1:** Mobile Gaming Operators (Tony Deane/AppLovin, Alex Gray/Unity, Eoin O'Doherty/Homa)
- **Cluster 2:** European Gaming Founders (Dylan Collins/10xHumans, Marek Rabas/MADFINGER, Steven Collins/Unity)
- **Cluster 3:** Esports/Brand Partnerships (Christoph Ebenschwaiger/Red Bull, Paul Breslin/Player 12)

**Implication:** Need three different value propositions, not one-size-fits-all messaging.

### 3. **Steven Collins (Unity CTO) = Highest Leverage Relationship**
- ONLY individual followed across multiple clusters
- Dual value: Unity technical partnership + VC fundraising (ex-Frontline Ventures)
- His Unity CTO announcement drew 1,399 engagement from multiple actors

**Implication:** Steven Collins is priority #1 relationship to develop.

## 🔴 Critical Problem: Geoffrey & James Have No LinkedIn Visibility

**Finding:** Neither Cyberlete co-founder appears in 3,991 engagement records from 13 ecosystem actors.

- Not posting on LinkedIn regularly

- Missing organic discovery opportunities

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Geoffrey Maunus: Post 1x personal story per month on LinkedIn (founder journey format)
2. James S.: Post 1x tactical insight per month on LinkedIn (competitive gaming trends)
3. Target: Appear in Barry's network feed at least 2-3x per month by Q1 2026
4. Study high-engagement posts (Riccardo Zacconi leaving King = 7,330 engagement)

## 🚨 Risk Flags

### 1. **Player 12 Competitive Threat**
Paul Breslin's Player 12 is in adjacent space with elite engagement (1,075.3 avg). Need competitive analysis ASAP.

**Action:** Research Player 12 product, funding, positioning. Decide: partner, compete, or acquire.

---

### 2. **Low Founder Visibility**
Neither Geoffrey nor James in 3,991 engagement records = not on ecosystem radar.

**Action:** LinkedIn content blitz starting NOW.

---

### 3. **Fragmented Ecosystem = No Viral Growth**
Only 0.6% author overlap means organic discovery won't work.

**Action:** Targeted 1:1 outreach to each cluster with customized messaging. No shortcuts.
