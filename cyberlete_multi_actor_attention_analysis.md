# Multi-Actor Attention Graph Analysis
## Strategic Intelligence for Cyberlete - November 2025

**Analysis Dataset:** 3,991 LinkedIn engagement records  
**Tracking:** 13 key individuals from gaming/esports ecosystem  
**Time Span:** 1 day to 7 years (with concentration in last 12 months)  
**Unique Content Creators:** 1,912 authors

---

## Executive Summary

This multi-actor attention graph reveals a **highly fragmented** gaming/esports professional network with **minimal overlap** in content consumption patterns. Each actor operates in distinct information spheres, suggesting specialized niches rather than a unified gaming ecosystem. For Cyberlete, this presents both challenges (no single influencer reaches all audiences) and opportunities (multiple entry points for different market segments).

**Key Findings:**
1. **EA and King dominate** mind-share across all actors (3,175 and 1,381 mentions respectively)
2. **Ad-tech/UA content** is the most consumed theme (24.1% of Tony Deane's attention)
3. **Three distinct tribal clusters** emerge: Mobile Gaming Operators, European Gaming Founders, and Esports/Brand Partnerships
4. **541 funding signals** and **279 partnership opportunities** detected - active deal-making environment
5. **Steven Collins** (Unity CTO) emerges as rare "bridge" author followed by 4 different actors

**Strategic Implication for Cyberlete:** The fragmented attention graph means Cyberlete cannot rely on organic discovery through network effects. Must execute **targeted outreach** to each cluster with customized positioning.

- Both are **recruiting targets** - actors track job opportunities
- Both have **large social media teams** - frequent content production

**Strategic Insight:** Cyberlete should **NOT try to compete with EA/King for attention**. Instead, position as "what comes next" after mobile casual gaming plateaus.

**2. Platform vs. Content Split:**
- **Platform companies** (Unity, AppLovin, Axon) generate high mentions relative to size
- **Content companies** (game studios) dominate but are more fragmented
- Suggests **platform plays have higher leverage** in this ecosystem

**Strategic Insight:** Cyberlete's positioning as **competitive gaming infrastructure platform** (not game developer) aligns with this attention pattern.

- 150 mentions driven primarily by Christoph Ebenschwaiger (but not exclusively)
- Demonstrates **brand partnerships are viable** in gaming ecosystem

## Strategic Recommendations for Cyberlete

### 1. Three-Cluster Outreach Strategy

**DO NOT use one-size-fits-all messaging.** Each cluster requires distinct positioning:

**Cluster 1 (Mobile Gaming Operators):**
- **Message:** "Cyberlete brings mobile UA attribution to competitive gaming"
- **Channels:** AppLovin Axon integration, Unity SDK partnership
- **Key Contacts:** Tony Deane (AppLovin), Alex Gray (Unity), Eoin O'Doherty (Homa)
- **Proof Points:** Show CPI/ROAS metrics for tournament participants, not just viewership

**Cluster 2 (European Gaming Founders):**
- **Message:** "Cyberlete is the Unity of competitive gaming - infrastructure, not content"
- **Channels:** VC intros via Frontline Ventures, Irish gaming ecosystem
- **Key Contacts:** Steven Collins (Unity/Frontline), Dylan Collins (10xHumans), Rich Barnwell (Entity)
- **Proof Points:** Platform GMV, developer adoption, European market traction

**Cluster 3 (Esports/Brand Partnerships):**
- **Message:** "Cyberlete enables grassroots esports, not just pro leagues"
- **Channels:** Red Bull partnership, Riot Games validation
- **Key Contacts:** Christoph Ebenschwaiger (Red Bull), Paul Breslin (Player 12), Benan Arigil (Riot)
- **Proof Points:** Community engagement metrics, amateur-to-pro pathways, brand sponsor ROI

---

### 2. Steven Collins as Priority Relationship

**Why:** Only individual followed by multiple clusters. Unique dual value:
- **Unity CTO:** Technical partnership for esports SDK/analytics
- **Ex-Frontline Ventures:** Can make warm intros to European VC ecosystem

**Approach:**
1. Research Unity's current esports offerings (Unity Gaming Services, analytics)
2. Identify gaps Cyberlete fills (tournament infrastructure, competitive player matching)
3. Reach out via Barry Keane introduction (Steven is in network)
4. Pitch as **Unity ecosystem expansion** - "Cyberlete makes Unity games competitive by default"
5. Ask for Frontline Ventures intro if product fit exists

**Timeline:** Q1 2026 - before Unity finalizes 2026 partnership roadmap

---

### 3. Red Bull Partnership Validation

**Why:** Christoph Ebenschwaiger's attention demonstrates Red Bull's grassroots esports model is valued in gaming ecosystem. Red Bull validation would give Cyberlete instant credibility.

**Approach:**
1. Study Red Bull's Gaming Events history (Christian Hesse built this)
2. Identify where Cyberlete solves Red Bull's pain points:
   - Local event organization at scale
   - Amateur player discovery pipeline
   - Sponsor ROI measurement for regional activations
3. Outreach via Barry Keane → Christoph Ebenschwaiger introduction
4. Pilot: **"Red Bull x Cyberlete Local Legends Tournament Series"**
   - Red Bull provides brand/venue
   - Cyberlete provides tournament infrastructure
   - Co-market results as case study

**Goal:** Red Bull logo on Cyberlete's partner page = instant esports credibility

---

### 4. AppLovin Axon Integration as Growth Lever

**Why:** Tony Deane's attention shows AppLovin/Axon dominates mobile gaming UA. Competitive gaming is just "another user acquisition channel" for mobile games. If mobile game publishers can run Cyberlete tournaments to acquire players, it's a massive distribution channel.

**Approach:**
1. Build Axon integration: Mobile games can create in-app tournaments via Cyberlete SDK
2. Track tournament-acquired users vs. other UA channels (likely lower CPI, higher LTV)
3. Pitch to Tony Deane: "Axon case study - competitive gaming as UA channel"
4. Get on AppLovin's radar as **Axon ecosystem partner**
5. Speak at AppLovin events alongside Tony

**Metric to Prove:** "Tournament players have 2.5x higher D30 retention than traditional UA" (or whatever the data shows)

**Timeline:** Q2 2026 - Axon is newly launched, early ecosystem partners get priority

### 5. Funding Strategy: Target Gaming-Focused VCs

**Signal:** 541 funding mentions show active investment climate. Multiple VCs mentioned:
- **vgames** (Eitan Reisel) - Fund III announced, actively deploying
- **Frontline Ventures** (Steven Collins connection) - European gaming investor
- **Laton Ventures** (Görkem Türk from Barry's network) - #2 globally in mobile gaming
- **a16z** - Mentioned 3 times in partnership contexts

**Approach:**
1. **Tier 1 Target: vgames** - Gaming-specific, Fund III fresh capital, Tony Deane engaged with announcement
2. **Tier 2 Target: Frontline Ventures** - European focus, Steven Collins warm intro pathway
3. **Tier 3 Target: Laton Ventures** - Via Görkem Türk from Barry's network (analyzed in previous report)

**Positioning:** "Cyberlete is AppLovin for esports - infrastructure layer that monetizes competitive gaming at scale, not another esports team/tournament organizer"

**Ideal Round:** Series A, $5-8M, Q2-Q3 2026

---

### 6. Content Strategy: Founder Journey Narratives

**Signal:** High-engagement posts are personal stories (Riccardo Zacconi leaving King, Steven Collins joining Unity, etc.)

**Cyberlete Application:**
- Geoffrey Maunus and James S. should post **personal journey content**:
  - "Why we're building Cyberlete after X years in gaming"
  - "The moment we realized esports infrastructure is broken"
  - "What we learned from [failure/pivot]"
- Tag relevant people in each cluster
- Post on **LinkedIn only** (where this ecosystem lives, not Twitter/X)

**Frequency:** 1 major post per month from founders, amplified by Cyberlete corporate account

---

### 7. Geographic Expansion: Ireland as European Hub

**Signal:** Multiple Irish actors in network (Steven Collins, Paul Breslin, Rich Barnwell, Eoin O'Doherty, hugh reynolds). Irish government (Simon Harris from Barry's network) shows support for gaming sector.

**Approach:**
1. Establish **Cyberlete Europe** entity in Dublin
2. Leverage IDA Ireland / Enterprise Ireland support for gaming startups
3. Hire Irish gaming talent (abundant due to King, Unity, Riot presences)
4. Use Irish entity to bid on EU gaming/esports grants
5. Position as "U.S.-Irish gaming infrastructure company" for best of both ecosystems

**Timeline:** H2 2026 - after Series A funding

---

### 8. Competitive Intelligence: Monitor Player 12

**Why:** Paul Breslin's Player 12 is in adjacent "interactive gaming" space. High engagement rate (1,075.3 avg) suggests he's onto something. Need to understand if Player 12 is:
- Direct competitor (building competitive gaming infrastructure)
- Potential partner (complementary interactive features)
- Acquisition target (if struggling, Cyberlete could acquire)

**Action Items:**
1. Research Player 12's current product, funding, team
2. Monitor Paul Breslin's LinkedIn for signals
3. If partnership makes sense, reach out via Barry Keane introduction
4. If competitive threat, differentiate clearly in messaging

---

### 9. Esports Event Strategy: Local > Global

**Signal:** Laurent Rumayor's regional French event (GPExplorer 3) generated 4,448 engagement - higher than many global tournaments. Christian Hesse's departure from Red Bull Gaming Events suggests opportunity to hire experienced local events leader.

**Cyberlete Positioning:** "We power local esports, not just $1M prize pool tournaments"

**Features to Build:**
- One-click local tournament creation
- Automated bracket management
- Sponsor integration for regional brands
- Amateur player ranking system
- Path from local winner → regional → national competition

**Go-to-Market:**
- Partner with **gaming cafes**, **university esports clubs**, **local brands** (not just endemic gaming sponsors)
- Christian Hesse as advisor/hire for this vertical

---

### 10. M&A Positioning: Build to Be Acquired

**Signal:** 80 M&A signals show active consolidation. Platform/infrastructure companies get acquired more than game studios.

**Potential Acquirers:**
1. **Unity** - Wants competitive gaming layer on Unity Gaming Services
2. **Epic Games** - Wants to expand beyond Fortnite esports
3. **Riot Games** - Wants infrastructure for non-League competitive games
4. **AppLovin** - Wants to monetize competitive gaming as UA channel
5. **Microsoft/Xbox** - Building competitive gaming ecosystem
6. **Meta** - Exploring gaming + VR/AR competitive experiences

**Build Strategy:**
- Make Cyberlete platform-agnostic (not tied to one game engine)
- Build API-first architecture (easy to integrate into acquirer's existing products)
- Show "attach rate" metrics (X% of games using Cyberlete see Y% competitive play increase)
- Target $30-50M valuation for 2027 acquisition

**Playbook:** Parallel path - build for organic growth AND position for strategic acquisition

---

## Critical Gaps & Unknowns

### 1. **Geoffrey Maunus & James S. LinkedIn Presence**
**Issue:** Despite being Cyberlete co-founders, neither appears in 3,991 LinkedIn engagement records from 13 ecosystem actors. This suggests:
- Low posting frequency
- Limited network overlap with gaming ecosystem
- Potential visibility problem

**Risk:** If ecosystem influencers aren't seeing Cyberlete founders' content, Cyberlete won't benefit from organic discovery.

**Action Required:** Dramatically increase LinkedIn presence. Aim for at least 1 appearance in Barry's network engagement feed per month.

---

### 2. **Cyberlete Product Readiness**
**Unknown:** Current state of Cyberlete platform, features, beta customers

**Need to Know:**
- Is product live or in development?
- Any existing tournaments/users?
- Technical architecture (can it integrate with Unity, AppLovin, etc.)?
- Competitive gaming genres supported (FPS, MOBA, fighting games, etc.)?

**Why It Matters:** Partnership discussions require clear answer to "what does Cyberlete do and for whom?"

---

### 3. **Competitor Landscape Beyond Player 12**
**Unknown:** Full competitive set of gaming tournament platforms

**Need to Map:**
- **Challengermode** (Nordic esports platform)
- **Toornament** (tournament bracket software)
- **Battlefy** (esports tournament platform)
- **StartGG** (fighting game community platform)
- **FaceIt** (competitive matchmaking)
- **ESL Play** (ESL's tournament platform)

**Action Required:** Competitive analysis document showing Cyberlete differentiation

---

### 4. **Funding History & Runway**
**Unknown:** Has Cyberlete raised capital? If so, how much and from whom? What's current runway?

**Why It Matters:** Dictates urgency of fundraising outreach, VC positioning, partnership prioritization

---

### 5. **Geographic Focus**
**Unknown:** Is Cyberlete currently US-only or global?

**Strategic Fork:**
- If US-only: Ireland expansion recommendation is aggressive but viable
- If already global: Focus on deepening one market before expanding further

---

## Measurement Framework

To track Cyberlete's ecosystem penetration over time:

### Monthly Metrics to Track

**1. LinkedIn Visibility Score**
- Appearances in Barry Keane's network engagement feed: Target 2-3/month
- Reactions from tracked actors (Dylan, Tony, Alex, etc.): Target 1-2/month
- Comment engagement from ecosystem players: Target 5+/month

**2. Network Penetration**
- Direct connections to 13 tracked actors: Current ?, Target 8+ by Q2 2026
- Intro paths mapped: Current ?, Target 13/13 by Q1 2026
- Meetings scheduled: Target 1 per cluster per quarter

**3. Partnership Pipeline**
- Conversations initiated: Target 2/month
- Active partnerships: Target 1 signed by Q2 2026 (Red Bull or AppLovin priority)
- Integration completed: Target Unity SDK by Q3 2026

**4. Funding Progress**
- VC intro meetings: Target 1-2/month
- Term sheets: Target 1 by Q2 2026
- Close: Target Series A by Q3 2026

## Appendix: Data Quality Notes

**Dataset:** 3,991 LinkedIn engagement records  
**Date Range:** 1 day to 7 years (with recency bias toward last 12 months)  
**Actors Tracked:** 13 individuals from Sales Navigator list

**Limitations:**
1. **Selection Bias:** Only tracks these 13 actors' public LinkedIn activity, not entire gaming ecosystem
2. **Platform Bias:** LinkedIn-only (no Twitter/X, Discord, or other gaming community platforms)
3. **Recency Weighting:** Some actors have 500 reactions (max captured), others far fewer - may reflect API limitations
4. **Self-Promotion:** Many actors react heavily to own posts (skews engagement metrics)
5. **Corporate Accounts:** Company pages (AppLovin, Unity, etc.) included as "authors" but aren't individuals

**Confidence Levels:**
- HIGH: Company mentions, thematic clustering, engagement rates
- MEDIUM: Tribal cluster definitions (low overlap makes clustering fuzzy)
- LOW: Individual author significance (small sample sizes for some authors)

**Recommended Refresh:** Quarterly re-pull of LinkedIn engagement data to track ecosystem evolution
