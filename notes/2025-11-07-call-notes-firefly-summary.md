Notes
Product Strategy and Market Positioning
The team is focused on building a competitive gaming ecosystem that simplifies tournament and league management while integrating a unique human verification anti-cheat system (01:35).
	•	Cyber Elite’s platform targets competitive gamers by combining tournament creation, league management, and community building in one place (16:10)
	•	The platform supports traditional tournament formats and introduces an innovative captain’s pick draft mode, fostering community engagement by allowing captains to draft players after the tournament starts
	•	Integration of game servers with premium bare metal hosting revives the classic competitive gaming experience with low latency and high performance
	•	User profiles sync with external accounts like Steam, and streaming is token-gated through their cryptocurrency, Leet Token, unlocking advanced features as users earn tokens
	•	The platform’s design addresses fragmentation by uniting fans, competitors, and entertainers into a cohesive esports triangle, mimicking real sports ecosystems (24:27)
	•	The team is pursuing a grassroots community growth strategy, starting with niche, passionate groups like the Gathering of the Nerds Call of Duty 2 community with about 500 monthly active users (32:32)
	•	These communities currently rely on inefficient tools like Excel and Google Sheets for tournament management, making Cyber Elite’s all-in-one solution an immediate upgrade (27:03)
	•	Cyber Elite’s solution reduces manual workload, increases community retention, and offers new social features like team server sharing and integrated chat, unavailable on other platforms (27:29)
	•	The focus on smaller, passionate communities provides strong initial traction and helps validate product-market fit before scaling to larger audiences (30:27)
	•	Long-term vision includes expansion into major titles like Counter Strike, with server integration underway but delayed due to a commitment to meet community expectations and cultural fit before launch (01:28:36)
	•	The Counter Strike community is known for low tolerance of poor products, so the team is cautious about timing their full launch to ensure quality and acceptance (01:29:03)
Technology and Infrastructure
Cyber Elite’s technology stack and infrastructure are designed to provide a seamless, scalable, and premium user experience tailored to competitive gaming needs (20:30).
	•	The platform uses bare metal servers for game hosting instead of cloud servers, ensuring low latency and high stability crucial for competitive play (20:30)
	•	This infrastructure supports instant server provisioning for games like Call of Duty 2, offering a fast and reliable experience for communities that value performance
	•	Integration with blockchain-based wallets (Privy) enables secure token transactions, seamless user onboarding via email or social logins, and multi-chain wallet support (01:23:29)
	•	The wallet system supports both the native Leet Token and stablecoins like USDC, with payment and payout licensing costing about $6,000 annually to enable compliance and faster transactions (01:02:50)
	•	Escrow smart contracts hold sponsor funds, enabling instant and automatic payouts post-tournament, solving common industry issues with delayed or missing payments (23:14)
	•	The platform is built with interoperability in mind, allowing full integration of Cyber Elite’s tech inside video games or as a standalone web experience (34:27)
	•	API-first design supports embedding tournament, team, and anti-cheat features directly in games, expanding reach and ease of use
	•	The team uses a beta site to test new features before production, ensuring stability and iterative improvement (16:10)
	•	Token gating creates a layered experience where users can unlock advanced features progressively, encouraging engagement and token utility (21:53)
Business Model and Monetization
The company aims to generate revenue primarily through server rentals, token economy, and licensing fees, with a clear path to scaling via community growth and partnerships (33:12).
	•	Current revenue comes from renting out excess computing power to users, which can be profitable even with a user base around 1,000 players (33:12)
	•	This revenue supports server costs and allows reinvestment into feature development and marketing
	•	The token economy, driven by Leet Token, incentivizes users to engage more deeply by unlocking features, minting NFTs for teams and stats, and participating in the platform’s ecosystem (21:53)
	•	Licensing costs include $3,000 annually for payment licensing and $3,000 for payout licensing, critical for legal compliance and building trust with sponsors and users (01:02:50)
	•	The team is targeting a $5 million fundraising goal with an initial tranche of $2 million to accelerate development, user experience improvements, and community expansion over the next 36 months (33:53)
	•	Investment will enable hiring more engineers to speed up feature delivery and improve platform stability (01:01:34)
	•	The current team is lean, with only two main developers, which limits growth speed without funding (01:01:34)
	•	There is a strong emphasis on protecting sponsor money with escrow and smart contract payout systems to prevent fraud and delays common in esports payouts (23:14)
	•	Instant payouts will differentiate the platform and attract professional gamers, broadcasters, and sponsors who suffer from slow payment cycles elsewhere (01:04:52)
Community Engagement and Growth Strategy
The platform’s growth hinges on partnering with existing competitive communities and tournament organizers to drive adoption and build credibility (26:00).
	•	The Gathering of the Nerds community serves as a flagship partner with about several hundred to a few thousand members, already running tournaments and using Cyber Elite’s servers and platform for league management (26:00)
	•	This community acts as a guinea pig for new features and a model for grassroots expansion (31:10)
	•	Meeting community leaders and attending LAN events has proven critical, as personal relationships convert interest into platform commitment (01:21:36)
	•	The team recognizes the fragmented nature of esports communities, spread across Discords, subreddits, and other platforms, and aims to unify these with an intuitive, all-in-one solution (28:38)
	•	Draft mode tournaments help users meet new players and create social bonds, reviving the community feel of early LAN gaming scenes (56:33)
	•	The platform supports sharing game servers among teams and communities, an unheard-of feature in competing platforms, enhancing collaboration (27:29)
	•	The growth approach is slow and deliberate, focusing on one community at a time to ensure product-market fit and sustainable monetization before scaling aggressively (32:32)
	•	The team plans to showcase the draft mode in a tournament within the next few weeks, leveraging live events for promotion and feedback (30:27)
	•	Expansion to additional games like Warcraft 3, Direct Strike, and Counter Strike is planned to broaden market reach (01:28:36)
Operational and Licensing Challenges
Navigating licensing and payment infrastructure is a key operational hurdle critical for scaling and user trust (01:02:46).
	•	The platform pays roughly $6,000 annually in combined licensing fees for payment and payout processing to maintain compliance and enable faster transactions (01:02:50)
	•	This includes licensing for crypto transactions (USDC and Leet Token) and fiat payments via PayPal and other providers
	•	The team is exploring partnerships with providers like Tapalte to improve payout efficiency and reduce fees beyond PayPal’s limited capabilities (01:24:45)
	•	Escrow smart contracts ensure sponsor funds are securely held and instantly released upon tournament completion, reducing risk of fraud (23:14)
	•	Faster payouts address a significant pain point where broadcasters and players often wait months for payment, causing financial hardship and damaging trust (01:04:52)
	•	For example, PayPal investigations can hold funds for up to 60 days, which is untenable for esports professionals (01:05:07)
	•	The team’s focus on user experience, inspired by Amazon’s success, aims to streamline financial flows and reduce friction in payouts (01:01:34)
Strategic Partnerships and Market Positioning
The team sees value in engaging with local and industry partners to accelerate growth and improve market fit (44:04).
	•	Introductions to industry experts like Alex, a former Unity CTO account manager with deep gaming ecosystem knowledge, are planned to leverage expertise and networks (44:04)
	•	Alex’s experience in ads and user acquisition could help refine go-to-market and scaling strategies (44:13)
	•	The team is open to investors and partners in Ireland and beyond, focusing on those who understand gaming and esports infrastructure (44:13)
	•	Barry Keane offered to facilitate introductions to investors and industry contacts based on upcoming tournament timelines in November and January (01:27:16)
	•	There is interest in exploring integrations with payment providers, wallet platforms like OKX, and crypto sponsors who invest heavily in esports to increase visibility and financial support (01:25:00)
	•	Partnerships with companies sponsoring esports teams or platforms could provide both financial backing and marketing reach (01:25:00)
	•	The team is also considering the parallels to successful microservice alliances in other industries, like the MACH Alliance, to build an ecosystem of interoperable services that appeal to larger customers (50:30)
	•	This approach could help break down complexity and create a modular, scalable platform attractive to diverse esports stakeholders (50:30)
