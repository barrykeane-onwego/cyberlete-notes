🧾 README – Cyberlete Financing Materials

I. Overview

This workspace consolidates all financing, investor, and growth strategy materials related to Cyberlete.
It integrates datasets, strategic notes, and AI-generated analyses across product, market, and financial planning streams.
Use this README to navigate source materials, track deliverables, and understand how each dataset connects to Cyberlete’s capital-raising process.

II. Purpose

The purpose of this workspace is to:
	•	Maintain a single, authoritative hub for all Cyberlete fundraising files.
	•	Provide clear cross-references between financial models, investor decks, LinkedIn network data, and advisory analyses.
	•	Support multi-tool collaboration (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Notebook LM) without losing context or duplication.
	•	Enable faster investor-ready packaging (executive summaries, opportunity memos, SBA applications, pitch decks, etc.).

III. File Structure

IV. Financing Context
	•	Target raise: $5 million USD over 36 months ($2 million initial tranche).
	•	Use of proceeds: engineering hires, feature acceleration, community scaling, licensing, and payout compliance.
	•	Revenue foundation: server rentals + token economy + licensing fees + sponsorship/partner integrations.
	•	Debt component: eligible for SBA or equipment-finance lines due to tangible server assets and predictable recurring usage.
	•	Equity strategy: blend strategic corporate investment (game engines, ad-tech platforms) with traditional VC capital.

IX. Extended Project Context

This section consolidates insights from the broader Cyberlete workspace so investors and collaborators can see how product, market, network, and financing threads interlock with the plan outlined above. It mirrors this README’s structure and tone for continuity.

1️⃣ LinkedIn Network Analysis Files

Sources: cyberlete_sales_nav_list_linkedin_reactions.csv, network summaries, and Claude Pass-3 outputs.
	•	Stakeholder & brand map (high-signal): recurring engagement around Unity, AppLovin, King, Riot Games, Meta, and PlayStation, plus advisors/operators like Dylan Collins and Todd Harris.
	•	Sponsor/partner ecosystems: ad-tech (UA/monetization), infrastructure (servers, wallets, AI safety/moderation), and publishers/IP owners show strong adjacency — ideal for co-marketing, SDK distribution, and pilot tournaments.
	•	Investor adjacencies: visibility into EU/US gaming funds and strategic corporate arms (engine, ads, infra) suggests potential for strategic equity participation alongside venture capital.
	•	Why it matters: this “interest graph” supports targeted outreach via warm paths and overlapping themes, reference architecture pilots (e.g., Riot internal leagues), and faster credibility building with named advisors.

⸻

2️⃣ Call Notes & Meeting Summaries

Sources: Nov 7 founder call notes and synthesis docs.
	•	Strategic aims: unify the competitive-gaming stack — tournaments + leagues + anti-cheat + premium bare-metal hosting + instant/escrow payouts — expanding from grassroots PC communities into larger titles.
	•	Identified gaps: lack of a mobile gaming strategy, limited performance marketing/UA, and few formal partnerships with platforms, publishers, or payment providers.
	•	Immediate next steps: ship draft-mode tournaments (Nov/Dec), prepare 8-week league (Jan), advance Counter-Strike integration, and engage the Irish ecosystem; finalize escrow/smart-contract payouts and payment/payout licensing.

⸻

3️⃣ Growth Opportunity Documents

Sources: Pass-3 synthesis and “opportunities” briefs.

Top initiatives with ROI impact:
	•	Mobile competitive expansion: Unity SDK pathway + casual competitive pilots (e.g., King) → ~10× audience expansion; revenue via entry fees, sponsorships, and server minutes.
	•	Performance Marketing/UA partnerships: partner with AppLovin to scale beyond grassroots; KPIs focused on CAC/LTV and tournament retention.
	•	Irish ecosystem activation: host infrastructure dinners with Riot/Meta/PlayStation Dublin teams → BD momentum and hiring channel.
	•	Advisory board formation: add gaming veterans (e.g., Dylan Collins, Todd Harris) to accelerate fundraising credibility.
	•	“MACH-for-Gaming” positioning: modular infrastructure alliance (voice moderation, wallets, anti-cheat) → enterprise narrative and integration upside.

⸻

4️⃣ Barry Keane / Finance Files

Sources: financing summary, outreach logs, and dealroom notes.
	•	Capital mix: combine SBA/asset-backed debt (server fleet, predictable usage) with strategic equity (platform/publisher/engine investors) and eventual mezzanine capital once MAUs and server utilization mature.
	•	Barry’s role: deliver warm intros (Unity, AppLovin, King, Riot, Irish Big Tech), recruit advisors, and craft the investor narrative — mobile expansion + instant payouts + infrastructure positioning.
	•	Process: sync the Investor Outreach Log with network insights; include the SBA dossier (business plan, DSCR, collateral schedules) for lender readiness.

⸻

5️⃣ Additional Artifacts (IP, Decks, AI Analyses, Sheets)
	•	Creator finance & payouts: studies of advance/factoring models for creators/tournament operators (sponsorship advances, faster prize payouts) reinforce Cyberlete’s instant-payout moat and strengthen BD with agencies.
	•	Pitch & executive artifacts: executive summaries, founder-network syntheses, and “Tight 10” scraping targets sharpen pipeline focus and deck proof points.
	•	GSheets / CSV links: canonical datasets (LinkedIn reactions, priority contacts) underpin query-driven outreach and enable rapid updates to the fundraising narrative.

⸻

Net effect: the extended workspace turns Cyberlete’s raise into a coherent go-to-market + capital plan — grassroots proof → mobile/UA scale → infrastructure alliances → strategic capital.
Each phase is validated by the interest graph, advisor network, and instant-payout differentiation, providing a clear, data-driven roadmap for growth and investment readiness.
