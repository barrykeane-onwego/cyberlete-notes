## I. Comparative Review of Financing Options

| Type | Ownership Dilution | Cash-Flow Burden | Speed | Strategic Value | Fit for Cyberlete |
|------|--------------------|------------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Equity (VC/Seed)** | High | None | Medium-Long | High | Excellent if traction and scalable plan exist |
| **Debt (Loan/Venture Debt)** | None | High | Medium | Low-Medium | Good only with stable revenues |
| **Revenue-Based Financing (RBF)** | None | Medium (variable) | Medium | Moderate | Attractive if recurring revenue visible |
| **Mezzanine / Hybrid** | Low-Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Bridge between equity and debt once cash flow matures |
| **Strategic Corporate Investment** | Low-Medium | Variable | Medium | **Very High** | Excellent match (channels + credibility) |
| **Crowdfunding** | Low-Medium | Low | Fast | Medium | Supplementary only |

### 1. Equity Financing
- **Use:** issue shares to angels / VCs / growth funds.  
- **Pros:** non-repayable, strategic support, validation.  
- **Cons:** dilution, governance, time to close.  
- **Target metrics:** ARR ≈ $1–2 m, >100 % YoY growth, LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1.

### 2. Debt Financing
- **Use:** working capital or expansion.  
- **Pros:** retain ownership, quicker than equity.  
- **Cons:** repayment risk, covenants.  
- **Hybrid note:** convertible debt or venture debt could bridge to Series A.

### 3. Revenue-Based Financing (RBF)
- Repay as % of revenue until capped multiple.  
- Non-dilutive, scalable with sales; best once MRR > $50–100 k.

### 4. Mezzanine Financing
- Subordinated debt + equity warrants.  
- Useful for **bridge between initial $2 m raise and later $3 m**; moderate dilution and moderate repayment pressure.

### 5. Strategic Corporate Investment
- Partner invests for access to tech or audience.  
- Highly suited to Cyberlete given gaming ecosystem synergies (hardware vendors, esports leagues, cloud providers).  
- **Goal:** secure $1–2 m strategic tranche to anchor Q1 2025 round.

### 6. Crowdfunding
- Community/marketing value; not primary route for $5 m total.

## II. Growth Targets to Secure Good Terms

| Metric | Target | Investor Rationale |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **ARR (run-rate)** | $1–2 m + | Demonstrates traction |
| **Revenue Growth YoY** | ≥ 100 % | Signals scalability |
| **CAC Pay-back** | ≤ 12 mo (ideally 6–9) | Efficient GTM |
| **LTV:CAC** | ≥ 3:1 | Profitable customer model |
| **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** | ≥ 110–120 % | Stickiness/expansion |
| **Gross Margin** | > 60 % | Scalable economics |
| **Cash Runway Post-Raise** | 12–18 mo | Financial discipline |

**Immediate prep priorities (Nov 2024 – Q1 2025)**
1. Clean and verify metrics (ARR, CAC, NRR).  
2. Build forecast showing use of $2 m → ARR growth to $4 m by end 2025.  
3. Document customer case studies & pipeline.  
4. Clarify use of funds and milestones.  
5. Prepare investor data room + sensitivity analysis.
